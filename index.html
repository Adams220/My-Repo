From 3500 - 5000 BCE, cave paintings were found in India with images of people in meditative postures with their eyes closed. 
        <br> <br>In some of the oldest written records from around 1500 BCE in India, the practice of Dhyāna or Jhāna is referenced as the training of the mind, often translated as meditation. Many of these records come from the Hindu traditions of Vedantism and discuss the various meditation practices across ancient India.
