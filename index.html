<p>Meditation is a practice of using the mind and body to focus on a particular object. It is usually done individually, in a seated position and with eyes closed.
    <br>In our society today, meditation is an extremely common practice and one that has helped millions of people find inner peace in their lives. 
    <br>Meditation is also practiced in Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. However, it is important to note that a person does not need to be religious to meditate.
